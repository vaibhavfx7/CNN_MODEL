HERE I WILL TELL YOU HOW I ARRANGED THE DATASET WHICH CONTAINS THE IMAGES OF DOGS AND CATS

# Create two folder named "train" and "test2" respectively
              #Each folder contains Two folder which helps the model to recognize the different types of binary images as the the class mode is binary
# I put 5000 cats images and 6000 dog images in Catx and Dagx folder in train folder respectively.
# I put 1000 cats images and 2000 dog images in Catx and Dagx folder in test2 folder respectively.
